## [3.1.0] - 2020-07-29

### Changed

- Update/remove various dependencies, resulting in a smaller bundle and better performance

## [3.0.1] - 2020-07-06

### Changed

- `requestPermissionsMiddleware`: Stringify `req.id` when defaulting to it as the permissions request ID
  - Allowing numerical IDs was a mistake
- `IPermissionsRequest`
  - Update type of `metadata.id` from `string | number` to `string`

## [3.0.0] - 2020-07-05

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `requestPermissionsMiddleware`: Stop using or setting the `id` property from the `IOriginMetadata` parameter
- **BREAKING:** `requestPermissionsMiddleware`: Default to `req.id` value as the pending permissions request object `id`, with `uuid()` as a fallback
- `requestPermissionsMiddleware`: Rename `IOriginMetadata` parameter from `metadata` to `domain`, in line with other middleware functions
  - Its former name led to confused usage by this package and its consumers
- Types
  - `IPermissionsRequest`
    - Remove top-level `origin` property, since there's already a `metadata.origin` property
    - Update type of `metadata.id` from `string` to `string | number`
  - `IOriginMetadata`
    - Remove `id` property, which is now never used in practice
